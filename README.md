Lovense API Redirect for the auto-generated links in the app.

<p>I've noticed that when sharing links the bots of whatever site is used will usually invalidate the link by viewing it. Also, when a link is generated with the app it is very long, but the only thing that is needed is the last 4 characters. So, to combat these problems I've made this simple site. By using the link https://tiny.cc/lar combined with a # and characters it will direct to the site. For example: https://api2.lovense.com/c/<mark>1234</mark> would become https://tiny.cc/lar#<mark>1234</mark></p>
